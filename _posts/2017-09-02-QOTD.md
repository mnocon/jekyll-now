The Amish use a canary approach when choosing which technologies to adopt. Kevin Kelley, “Wired” Founding Executive Editor & “The Inevitable” author/futurist, explains how on This Week In Startups. The Amish aren't luddites, they're slow followers, selective curators who admit technologies into their portfolio based on deeply held core principles. Individuals don't choose which technologies to adopt, the community decides based on how it impacts the family and community. They ask: will this technology allow me to spend more time with my family? Will this technology increase the strength of our community? Cell phones are allowed, smart phones are not. Cars were rejected because they let people travel far away from family and community. A horse & buggy keeps everyone within a 15 mile radius. Eating meals together as a family is important, so the Amish create backyard businesses. Using a CNC milling machine is OK because it keeps the family together. Solar panels and chain saws are also OK. They have Amish computers, which are computers without an internet connection. And the computer is used in the office only, not at home. How do they pick which technologies to use? They try them. One or two early adopter families use a technology and they are observed. If it's deemed the technology hurts the family or the community, then the technology is voted off the island.
