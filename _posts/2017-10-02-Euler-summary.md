title: Solving 100 Project Euler problems - summary
---

Not so long ago (on 11.07.2017 to be exact) I've decided to give [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) a try. I wanted to solve 1 challenge every day until 100 problems are solved, and I can happily say I've finished this mission ahead of schedule.

Things I've learned:

* Better knowledge of Python libraries
* Better understanding of typical data structures like lists, sets and dictionaries
* How to search for algorithms and implement them
* How to write small, testable methods (note: almost each problem comes with solution to an easier variation of the problem, providing data for tests)

Now I'd like to focus more on how design patterns and organising code in larger codebases, so I will not continue with the next 100 Problems. It was fun though!

You can see that I've started extremely fast, always having more issues solved than days passed since the beggining. When I was leaving for holidays I did the same thing, solving more than needed to be ahead. At the end all it took was one Saturday evening, leaving me with only two Problems left - solving them was a pleasure.
