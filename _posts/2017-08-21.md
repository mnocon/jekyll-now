Talking Heads frontman David Byrne believes technology is making each of us more alone and more atomized by swapping out humans in our daily lives for machines (tellers for ATMs, checkout clerks for checkout scanners, drivers for self-driving software, delivery drivers for drones&landbots, and so on).
…”Our random accidents and odd behaviors are fun—they make life enjoyable. I’m wondering what we’re left with when there are fewer and fewer human interactions. Remove humans from the equation, and we are less complete as people and as a society,” he writes.
